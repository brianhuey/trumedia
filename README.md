- To analyze the data produced by the model, run `run_console.py` within a console
like IPython.
- The `batters` object will be generated which has a number of methods to transform the data
- `batters.df` will produce the full pandas DataFrame 
- All data within /leaderboards should be reproduceable from the `batters` object.
